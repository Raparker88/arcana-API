Card 4 will often reveal a subconscious impulse - perhaps a blockage which is stopping you from achieving your desired result. Card 5 shows the possible results from taking a given course of action. The spread works best if, whilst selecting the cards, you concentrate on one aspect of the decision, rather than either/or type questions."
